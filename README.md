## running it

You can run it but you need to hook it up to a firebase project and also if you want voices deploy the functions folder with a key to elevenlabs.

- npm install from the ui folder
- ng serve as its angular
- you need to provide your firebase settings in the environment.ts under src/environments

## Interested

Please feel free to contact me about the idea. The arena is a nice change from talking to standard LLMs.
